**Project title: Rethinking the author: Heterogeneity of The Story of The Stone in English**


**About Me:** I'm a rising senior at UC Berkeley double majoring Molecular & Cell Biology and Chinese language. My research interest involves modern China and contemporary Taiwanese literature.  

This project is for Digital Humanity 100/101 course (2021 Summer). My research builds upon the pre-existing scholarship on the authorship of The Story of the Stone, the most acclaimed long novel in Chinese literary history. Instead of focusing on the various editions of the original texts, I pay attention to Hawkes and Minford’s translation in English in order to investigate the degree of homogeneity achieved by translation and textual manipulation.

This research is going to answer the following questions:

How homogeneous Hawkes’ first 80 chapters is?
What is happening in Bing-Cho Chan's methodology and what would happen if we repeat his method on the English translation?
This repository involves the text folder, two code files(jupyter notebook), a storyboard (with earlier versions), a poster and parsing results.
